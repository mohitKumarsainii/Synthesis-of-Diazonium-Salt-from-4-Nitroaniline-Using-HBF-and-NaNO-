# **Synthesis of Diazonium Salt from 4-Nitroaniline Using HBF₄ and NaNO₂**

## **Introduction**
This process outlines the preparation of **diazonium salt** from **4-nitroaniline** using **hydrogen tetrafluoroborate (HBF₄)** and **sodium nitrite (NaNO₂)**. The formed **diazonium salt (C₆H₄NO₂N₂⁺BF₄⁻)** is an important intermediate in organic synthesis, useful for various reactions such as azo coupling and electrophilic aromatic substitution.

## **Materials**
- **4-nitroaniline (C₆H₄NO₂NH₂)**
- **Hydrogen tetrafluoroborate (HBF₄)**
- **Sodium nitrite (NaNO₂)**
- **Diethyl ether (C₂H₅OC₂H₅)**
- **Acetonitrile (CH₃CN)**

## **Procedure**

### Step 1: Preparation of the Reaction Mixture
1. **Weighing and Mixing**:
   - Weigh **solid 4-nitroaniline** and mix it with **liquid HBF₄** in a **1:1 ratio**.
   - Stir the mixture to dissolve the **4-nitroaniline** in **HBF₄**, forming a **greenish solution**.

2. **Cooling and Stirring**:
   - Place the reaction mixture in an **ice bath** (0-5°C) to maintain low temperatures.
   - Stir the mixture with a magnetic stirrer for **15 minutes**, while passing **nitrogen gas** through the solution to avoid oxidation.

### Step 2: Formation of Nitrous Acid
3. **Sodium Nitrite Solution**:
   - Prepare a solution of **sodium nitrite (NaNO₂)** in **distilled water** in a **1:2 molar ratio** to **4-nitroaniline**.

4. **Addition of Sodium Nitrite**:
   - Add the **sodium nitrite solution** dropwise to the reaction mixture.
   - During this step, you will notice the formation of **reddish-brown fumes**, indicating the presence of **NO₂** gas.

### Step 3: Formation of Diazonium Salt
5. **Diazonium Salt Formation**:
   - The reaction of **sodium nitrite (NaNO₂)** with **4-nitroaniline** in the acidic medium leads to the formation of the **diazonium ion (C₆H₄NO₂N₂⁺)**.
   - The **diazonium salt (C₆H₄NO₂N₂⁺BF₄⁻)** is formed when the diazonium ion reacts with **BF₄⁻** from **HBF₄**.

6. **Filtration and Purification**:
   - After 40-45 minutes, filter the reaction mixture using **vacuum filtration** to remove any unreacted material.
   - Wash the filtered product with **diethyl ether** to purify the **diazonium salt**.

7. **Recrystallization**:
   - Dissolve the crude **diazonium salt** in **cold acetonitrile (CH₃CN)**.
   - Add **diethyl ether dropwise** to the solution, causing the pure **diazonium salt** to precipitate out as **whitish needle-like crystals**.

## **Final Product**
The final product is **4-nitrobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate**, which can be used for various reactions, such as **azo coupling** or further electrophilic substitution reactions.

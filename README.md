# Synthesis-of-Diazonium-Salt-from-4-Nitroaniline-Using-HBF-and-NaNO-
This process outlines the preparation of diazonium salt from 4-nitroaniline using hydrogen tetrafluoroborate (HBF₄) and sodium nitrite (NaNO₂). The formed diazonium salt (C₆H₄NO₂N₂⁺BF₄⁻) is an important intermediate in organic synthesis, useful for various reactions such as azo coupling and electrophilic aromatic substitution.
